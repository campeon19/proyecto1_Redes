# Proyect 1 - Using an existing protocol

This project consisted of implementing a simple chat using the open protocol eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), which is a protocol for instant messaging. It is inspired by XML. It is different to most protocols because it is an open standard. This means that anybody who has a domain name and an internet connection can run their own server. Most of the software and the clients are open source.

This project aims to adhere to the standards of a known and open protocol and understand the bases of asynchronous programming to adhere to the needs of network development.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run the program it is necessary to install the following libraries:

- [xmpppy](https://github.com/xmpppy/xmpppy)
- [slixmpp](https://slixmpp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

### Installing

To install the xmpppy library, run the following command on the command line

```
pip install xmpppy
```

To install the slixmpp library, run the following command on the command line

```
pip install slixmpp
```

## Build With

The following libraries are used in te project:

- logging - for debugging
- getpass - for password inputs
- asyncio - for asynchronous processes
- xmpppy - to create a new user
- slixmpp - to facilitate communication with the XMPP protocol
